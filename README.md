# Voting Precinct Size

This is a project to create an interactive graph of precinct size in Chester County, to answer the question "how much bigger are the _biggest_ precincts in Chester County, compared to the smallest ones?"

Anecdotally, some precincts have thousands and thousands of voters, but some only have a few hundred and are easy to manage.  Where are the big precincts? Does anything seem odd about where the biggest, hardest-to-manage precincts are? This will be a way of exploring that.

I plan to use [VictoryChart](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-chart/) as my charting library, and find precinct-size data someplace easy to point to.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
